# Basic-Portfolio
In this assignment, I built a professional portfolio site using HTML/CSS
## Instruction and Skills Required
1. Create a new repository in GitHub called `Basic-Portfolio`.

2. Clone this repository to your computer using the process we went over in class.

3. Navigate to the `Basic-Portfolio` folder that you just cloned onto your machine. Inside this folder, create the following:

   * 3 HTML documents: `index.html`, `contact.html` and `portfolio.html`.
   * A folder called `assets`.
   * Inside the assets directory, make two additional folders: `css` and `images`.
     * In the `css` folder, make a file called `style.css`.
     * In the `images` folder, save the images you plan on using (like your profile image and the placeholder images for the portfolio).

4. Push the above changes to GitHub.

   * Make sure to `git add .` and `git commit -m "initial site files"`. Then type `git push origin master` to push your changes to your GitHub repo.

5. Reference these screenshots for your site:

   ![Portfolio About](Images/portfolio-about-me.png)

   ![Portfolio Contact](Images/portfolio-contact.png)

   ![Portfolio Gallery](Images/portfolio-gallery.png)

   * **IMPORTANT** Your site's layout must match the designs in these screenshots. You'll find the specs for these designs below.

6. When you create a website, it's standard practice to code your HTML files before writing any CSS and to write up one HTML file before moving onto the next. Write your HTML semantically, too:

   * If something is a heading, you use a heading tag.
   * If something is a list, you use an unordered or ordered list tag.
   * So on and so forth.

7. The content for the `index.html` should be unique to **you**.

   * Write a paragraph or two about yourself. Make it fun, show your personality!
   * The main logo where it says "Your Name" should say your name. This may make the logo section smaller or wider depending on how long your name isâ€”that is fine and expected.
   * Add, commit, and push your code to GitHub often, especially when you complete a page.

8. After all of your HTML is written, you can begin styling your pages using the `style.css` file you created.

   * Be sure to [validate your html](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input).
   * Consult the specs below these instructions for advice on styling your CSS files.

9. Push your changes to Github.
